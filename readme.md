Galge Pitch -

Initial Screen 
As a user, when the title screen loads, a prompt appears where I will input my name
User’s name will be interpolated throughout conversations for immersion
As a user, I would like to control if music is playing or not, by clicking a button at the top of the screen
Game title will be displayed over name submission field

Regular gameplay
As a user, I would like to view the character I am speaking to, which will be featured in the center of the screen
Background art will feature behind the NPC character asset (would like to change the background depending on locale change if story calls for it, otherwise for the sake of the project one background image would be sufficient)
As a user, I will interact with the NPC on screen by reading their dialogue through a text box at the bottom of the screen, then offered a set of responses that I can choose from
As a user, depending on my choices, I will reach between one of three endings.
As a user, clicking the dialogue box (or maybe anywhere on the screen) will advance the text
As a user, I can press a button at the top of the screen to remove the text box and other ui features so that I can view the art asses without the UI being in the way
As a user, I would press a button that would display logs of previous dialogue and player choices (would like a button that toggles display of text logs)

Win state/Loss State
As a user, wrong choices can lead to a bad end, which could be used as a loss state for the player
As a user, I will “win” by reaching the neutral or good ending
